Missing data (MD) is a common issue afflicting research and evaluation studies.
It can be a result of poor study implementation, participant choices, equipment
failure, and many other circumstances. Entirely avoiding it is difficult and
rare. **>** If you do much evaluation work, you *will* eventually run into some 
missing data issues. Therefore, it is worth learning about the issue and how to
handle it.

## What is Missing Data?

Any measurement you intended to obtain, but did not get. 

* Skipped items, instruments, visits, ...
* Illegible or irrelevant responses
* Refusal to answer
* Don't know
* Lost records 
* Study dropout 

::: {.notes}
In the simplest terms, missing data is simply a measurement that you intended to 
obtain but did not get. Perhaps your survey asked a particular question, but the  
participant skipped that item without recording any response. Or maybe they 
responded but the answer was illegible, or they explicitly refused to answer the 
question, or simply said "I don't know". Those are all examples of how a 
measurement you wanted to collect may not be obtained. 

While you can sometimes categorize what kind of missing data you have or why it 
is missing, the basic problem is that you didn't get all the data you need.

## Ethics: Guiding Principles for Evaluators
Handling missing data well enacts our guiding principles [@AEA-RN8648]:

Thoughtful handling of missing data is a good way to enact several of AEA's 
guiding principles for evaluators, namely systematic inquiry, competence, and 
integrity.

## Types of Missingness

* Item-level 
* Construct 
* Person-period 
* Planned vs unplanned

## Mechanisms of Missingness

* Missing completely at random (MCAR)
* Missing at random (MAR)
* Missing not at random (MNAR)

## MCAR
MCAR is when neither observed nor unobserved variables predict which data is missing

## MAR

## MNAR

# Consequences
What are the consequences of missing data? 

## Bias
In appropriate handling of missing data can cause analyses to yield biased 
results. 

## Generalizability
Misalignment of analyzed sample and intended population

## Power
Most statistical software defaults to listwise deletion of cases that have any 
missing values on the variables involved in an analysis. That reduces statistical
