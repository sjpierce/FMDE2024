  data-notes: "1 hr (45-50 min talk + 10-15 min Q & A) My talk today focuses on 
  some concepts and issues related to missing data in program evaluation 
  contexts. My expertise lies in applied statistics, so I'll focus on aspects of 
  missing data relevant to quantitative methods and statistical analyses. Even 
  still, missing data is a big topic and this is just a short talk, so my goal 
  is to teach some fundamental ideas, share some insights and practical advice, 
  then offer resources you can use to learn more on your own. Jot down either my 
  email address or the link you see at the bottom of the screen. My slides, 
  complete with speaker notes, reference list, and links to resources, will be 
  available from that link."

Missing data (MD) is a common issue afflicting research and evaluation studies.
It can be a result of poor study implementation, participant choices, equipment
failure, and many other circumstances. Entirely avoiding it is difficult and
rare. **>** If you do much evaluation work, you *will* eventually run into some 
missing data issues. Therefore, it is worth learning about the issue and how to
handle it.

## What is Missing Data?

Any measurement you intended to obtain, but did not get. 

* Skipped items, instruments, visits, ...
* Illegible or irrelevant responses
* Refusal to answer
* Don't know
* Lost records 
* Study dropout 

::: {.notes}
In the simplest terms, missing data is simply a measurement that you intended to 
obtain but did not get. Perhaps your survey asked a particular question, but the  
participant skipped that item without recording any response. Or maybe they 
responded but the answer was illegible, or they explicitly refused to answer the 
question, or simply said "I don't know". Those are all examples of how a 
measurement you wanted to collect may not be obtained. 

While you can sometimes categorize what kind of missing data you have or why it 
is missing, the basic problem is that you didn't get all the data you need.

## Ethics: Guiding Principles for Evaluators
Handling missing data well enacts our guiding principles [@AEA-RN8648]:

Thoughtful handling of missing data is a good way to enact several of AEA's 
guiding principles for evaluators, namely systematic inquiry, competence, and 
integrity.

## Types of Missingness

* Item-level 
* Construct 
* Person-period 
* Planned vs unplanned

## Mechanisms of Missingness

* Missing completely at random (MCAR)
* Missing at random (MAR)
* Missing not at random (MNAR)

## MCAR
MCAR is when neither observed nor unobserved variables predict which data is missing

## MAR

## MNAR

# Consequences
What are the consequences of missing data? 

## Bias
In appropriate handling of missing data can cause analyses to yield biased 
results. 

## Generalizability
Misalignment of analyzed sample and intended population

## Power
Most statistical software defaults to listwise deletion of cases that have any 
missing values on the variables involved in an analysis. That reduces statistical


[@Fernández-García-RN4151; McKnight-RN1296]

# Diagnosis

## Describing the Amount of MD

[McKnight-RN1296]

* Numbers & percentages of complete & incomplete cases 
* Number and percentage of missing values for each variable
* Nature and frequency of missing data patterns

## Predictors of Attrition & Missingness in Longitudinal Studies

* Study arm: Compare retention rates 
* Study site (in multisite studies)
* Baseline/pretest values of outcome variables may predict who drops out or has 
  missing values
* Other covariates (demographics, site, )

# Treatment

# Prevention

An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure

@Wisniewski-RN2978

# Advice

* Collaborate with a statistician! 

## Practical Options

* Item-level missingness in scale scores [@Graham-RN1615; @Newman-RN8223]
